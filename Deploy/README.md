###For HPE-cloud kubernetes deployment:

Following the instructions:

[Deploy Harbor on Kubernetes](../docs/kubernetes_deployment.md)

For building ui part, use different command, since building uses different image file and dockerfile scripts.
```
sudo docker build -f kubernetes/dockerfiles/ui-dockerfile -t {your_account}/deploy_ui:latest ..
```

And follow the changes below:

1. Change hostname in harbor.cfg as harbor.cfg.hpecloud shows.
2. ~~After deploying the service, change hostname in nginx config file:~~
  ```
  config/nginx/nginx.conf
  config/nginx/nginx.https.conf
  ```
  ~~replace 'upstream registry/upstream ui', the server ip with cluster ip in kubernetes.~~
  
  nginx config file will be generated by 'envsubst' program in depoyment yaml file in this [this commit](https://github.hpe.com/liang-huang/harbor/commit/9c240eaafeed87b726b15e51f87df72998a3dd96)

3. ~~Change registry config file:~~
  ```bash
  kubernetes/dockerfiles/registry-config.yml
  ```
  1. Change 'auth: token: realm' to hostname same as hostname in harbor.cfg.hpecloud config file.
  2. Change 'notifications: endpoints: url' to according hostname (with port specified).
  
  >This change cannot use the cluster ip in kubernetes, because it is accessed from outside host.
  Registry config file will be generated by 'envsubst' program in deployment in this [commit](https://github.hpe.com/liang-huang/harbor/commit/a7a35c7762d622327e6c02b1710050a89856fb11)

4. After changing proxy and registry, rebuild these images and push them to repository.

5. Then create pod with these images and deploy it in kubernetes.
  ```bash
  # create service in the kubernetes cluster first
  kubectl create -f kubernetes/mysql-svc.yaml -f kubernetes/proxy-svc.yaml -f kubernetes/registry-svc.yaml -f kubernetes/ui-svc.yaml
  ...update proxy and registry images, docker build and docker push...
  # create and bind the pod to the service
  kubectl create -f kubernetes/mysql-rc.yaml -f kubernetes/proxy-rc.yaml -f kubernetes/registry-rc.yaml -f kubernetes/ui-rc.yaml
  ```

###The USE of Harbor

If the the registry is `c9t24960.itcs.hpecorp.net:31366`, the user `test` create a project named `prj-1` and try to push an image `nginx` with tag `1.7.2`, the push command as below:
```bash
docker login c9t24960.itcs.hpecorp.net:31366
username:test
password:

......
docker push c9t24960.itcs.hpecorp.net:31366/prj-1/nginx:1.7.2
```
[Failed to push image](https://github.com/vmware/harbor/issues/80)
>Currently harbor does not have a personal namespace. Every namespace has to be a project.
